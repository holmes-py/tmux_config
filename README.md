# This is my tmux config:


### Features: 
1. Show VPN IP address in status bar when connected to VPN.
2. Supports mouse functions. i.e. Mouse clicks can be used to switch splits, windows, sessions etc. Scrolling with mouse wheel activates copy mode and you can select using mouse cursor.


Update 24/01/2023:
- Cleaned up a bit, it was a homemade noodle soup before, now it's like out of a restaurant noodle soup.
- Updated colors a bit, finally added tmux plugins.
- Removed the bashrc, as it was overwriting the user's bashrc. 

Potential TODO:
- I believe my color choices can be boring at times, so feel free to send a PR if you have a better color scheme.

### Screenshots:
Default look with Tunnel and SSH scripts. Remove those if you think it's too messy.

- For some icons to properly display in tmux, you might make an alias to tmux:
```bash
alias tmux='tmux -u'
```
> Don't forget to add this in your shell rc file.

- If using arch, you can directly install icons-in-terminal

```
sudo pacman -Ss icons-in-terminal
```
- If using debian based, you need to clone and install icons-in-terminal from this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastiencs/icons-in-terminal.git
cd icons-in-terminal
./install.sh
```
> Start new terminal, and `cd icons-in-terminal` directory and do:

`./print_icons.sh` to verify successful installation
