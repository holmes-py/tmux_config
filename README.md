# This is my tmux config:


### Additional edits can: 
1. Show VPN IP address in status bar when connected to VPN.
2. Supports mouse functions. i.e. Mouse clicks can be used to switch splits, windows, sessions etc. Scrolling with mouse wheel activates copy mode and you can select using mouse cursor.


#### In my opinion it looks better.

#### Installation:
`git clone https://github.com/holmes-py/tmux_config.git`
`cd tmux_config`
`cp tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`
`cp VPN.sh ~/VPN.sh`
